## Content-Based Course Recommendation System

### Overview

The Content-Based Course Recommendation System is a Python-based application designed to suggest courses to users based on their preferences and interests. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on user behavior and collaborative filtering, this system leverages the content attributes of courses to make personalized recommendations.

### Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides course suggestions tailored to individual user interests by analyzing course content.
- **Flexible Content Analysis:** Supports various content attributes including course descriptions, topics, and tags.
- **Scalability:** Capable of handling large datasets with ease, making it suitable for a wide range of educational institutions and platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for inputting user preferences and displaying course recommendations.

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** The system ingests a dataset of courses, which includes details such as course titles, descriptions, topics, and tags.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant features from course descriptions and other content attributes.
3. **User Profile Building:** Creates a user profile based on their interests, preferences, and previously viewed courses.
4. **Similarity Measurement:** Computes similarity scores between user profiles and course content using vector space models.
5. **Recommendation Generation:** Ranks and recommends courses based on the computed similarity scores.
